## Flash Memory

- software for embedded systems called firmware, is stored in 


## HSI RC

- High speed internal RC circuit
- this is for generating the clock

## Clock 

- our clock has a max speed of 80MHz
- there is an internal 16MHz RC oscillator
- multiply it by x10
- divide it by 2

## Serial vs Parallel

- serial is much better for high speed
- because in parallel costs more (more copper req)
  - also, the busses can induce noise onto its neighbord
